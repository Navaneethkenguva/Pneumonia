# 🫁 Lung X-ray Pneumonia Detection Web App

A smart, AI-powered web application to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Built with a deep learning model (CNN) and deployed via Flask with a modern TailwindCSS-based interface.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that requires timely detection for effective treatment. Traditional diagnosis through manual X-ray examination can be time-consuming and error-prone. This project automates pneumonia detection from chest X-rays using a trained deep learning model, offering a quick and accessible web interface for predictions.
